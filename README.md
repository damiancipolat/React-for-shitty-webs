# React boilerplate for shitty (limited / oldest) project

I know the mix of current technologies with old ones is not always synonymous with success but in some scenarios of freelance projects it can be the difference of maintaining a commercial relationship with a client without suffering as a developer.

This repository comes out of my experience of a project working with **PHP + Wordpress + Goddady** (only access via FTP and Cpanel).

### Solution:
After researching I found a good combination of options. Wordpress Headless and React included as script.

It is to use the API-REST included in Wordpress and use this software only CMS, some usefull links:
